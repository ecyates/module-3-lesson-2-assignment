# Module 3 - Lesson 2 - Python Tuples
Author: Elizabeth Yates

1. Tuple Mastery in Python
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of tuples in Python.

Task 1: Formatting Flight Itineraries Create a Python function that takes a list of tuples as an argument. Each tuple contains information about a flight itinerary: (traveler_name, origin, destination). The function should format and return a string that lists each itinerary. For example, if the input is `[("Alice", "New York", "London"), ("Bob", "Tokyo", "San Francisco")]`, the output should be a string formatted as:

"Itinerary 1: Alice - From New York to London
 Itinerary 2: Bob - From Tokyo to San Francisco"

 2. Python Data Structure Challenges in Real-World Scenarios
Task 1: Library System Enhancement Sharpen your skills in managing and modifying data within tuples and lists.

Problem Statement: You are maintaining a library system where each book is stored as a tuple within a list. Your task is to update this system by adding new books and ensuring no duplicates.

Existing Library Data:

library = [("1984", "George Orwell"), ("Brave New World", "Aldous Huxley")]
- Add functionality to insert new books into `library`. Ensure that adding a duplicate book is handled appropriately.
